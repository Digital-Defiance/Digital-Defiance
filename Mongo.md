# MongoDB

We have a partnership with MongoDB.com

If you need a MongoDB database for your project, run it by the [Board](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/Digital-Defiance/wiki/Board-Members) for approval and we’ll get you the access you need. We have a limited credit / budget ($500 one time grant).Please make use of the Free Sandbox tier. We’ll add you to our organization.
