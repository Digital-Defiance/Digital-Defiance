# Guild

A 501c3 (incorporated in WA State) Guild of Open Source Software Engineers working together to make the best use of their free time in order to further projects of value to mankind.

* Founded in 2022 by Jessica Mulein on GitHub with the help of BDisp and Rui Campos.
* We have our own passion projects which are generally for the planet, both fun/demonstrative as well as libraries to enable those.
* We also look for deserving open source projects that need either process coaching, an extra hand fixing bugs, or any other need.
* Contributors generally help each-other's passion projects and work towards common goals as a team to work more effectively.
* Contributors receive peer mentoring and learn agile processes and enterprise development methodologies
* Everyone is essentially a partner in an open source group run like a high velocity agile team at any big enterprise
  * Okay! Okay! You got me! Slow velocity, but we'll get there!
  * Also there is absolutely zero pressure to perform at any given time! Whatever anyone contributes is great, but try not to commit to work and vanish!
  
## 501c3 Open Source Software Engineering Guild

Digital Defiance is an open source software engineering guild.

* Members get access to discounted software and other perks with our nonprofit status.
  * Software is licensed to be used for open source projects only.
* Members mentor each other using our pet projects that are generally for the public good.
* Members try to prioritize working on designated critical tasks from community projects- generally on GitHub.
* We'll have occasional meetings to discuss which project tasks go to the top of the pile and try to generally follow and teach Agile principles.
* There is already a 24-7 chatroom on Keybase where we already have several members discussing various projects being worked on.
* This is not (yet?) a union and we are open source developers working in an unpaid volunteer capacity.
* Dues will go towards our software subscriptions and other overhead
* Additional income beyond our needs will possibly be distributed to developers as bug/ticket bounties.
* If this sounds good to you, check out DigitalDefiance.org or email jessica@digitaldefiance.org
