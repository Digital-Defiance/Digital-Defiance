- node-GitDB

  Node-GitDB is a unique, pre-alpha stage project that synchronizes a Git repository of Markdown files into MongoDB and enables data querying via Mongo and a REST API. The project combines the capabilities of Git, MongoDB, and Node.js, translates Markdown data into MongoDB records, and houses a node express RESTful service. A Docker image is also included for easy, platform-independent deployment. While still in development, Node-GitDB presents a novel approach to managing and querying small datasets.
