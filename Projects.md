- [OpenBook](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/OpenBook)

  OpenBook is a unique, beta stage project that synchronizes a Git repository of Markdown files into MongoDB and enables data querying via Mongo and a REST API. The project combines the capabilities of Git, MongoDB, and Node.js, translates Markdown data into MongoDB records, and houses a node express RESTful service. A Docker image is also included for easy, platform-independent deployment. While still in development, OpenBook presents a novel approach to managing and querying small datasets.

- [Dominion ASsistant](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant)

    Enhance your physical Dominion game sessions with this comprehensive digital companion. Built with React and Capacitor for cross-platform use (web, iOS, Android), Dominion Assistant meticulously tracks game state, including player turns, resources (actions, buys, coins, VP), and expansion-specific mats like Coffers and Villagers. It maintains a detailed turn-by-turn log, calculates valuable game statistics, monitors supply pile counts, and allows you to save and load games in progress. Focus more on strategy and less on bookkeeping with this handy tool designed to streamline your Dominion experience, supporting various expansions like Alchemy, Renaissance, and Rising Sun.

- [Star Realms Assistant](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/StarRealmsAssistant)

  Elevate your physical Star Realms game experience with this versatile digital companion. Leveraging the same robust React and Capacitor foundation as the Dominion Assistant for cross-platform compatibility (web, iOS, Android), this tool is tailored specifically for Star Realms gameplay. It seamlessly tracks crucial game elements like player Authority, generated Combat and Trade, while also incorporating unique Star Realms features such as support for cooperative Boss players and monitoring the Boss's Assimilation score. With detailed logging and save/load capabilities, the Star Realms Assistant lets you focus on galactic strategy by handling the essential bookkeeping.

- [MetaDeck](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/MetaDeck)

  Elevate your competitive play with MetaDeck, a dedicated platform for matchmaking and in-depth game analysis. Designed to integrate with companion apps like Dominion Assistant and Star Realms Assistant, MetaDeck captures your completed game data, allowing you to dive deep into past matches and analyze your strategic evolution over the long term. Track your performance, refine your tactics, and connect with other players through its matchmaking features. While initially supporting Dominion and Star Realms, MetaDeck is built with the vision to potentially incorporate other games in the future, serving as your central hub for serious strategy game analysis and community connection. Uses Amazon Cognito and DynamoDB.

- [BrightChain](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/BrightChain)

  BrightChain is pioneering next-generation decentralized infrastructure, moving beyond traditional blockchain limitations. We are developing a secure and efficient ecosystem featuring innovative decentralized storage based on Owner-Free Filesystem principles ("Bright Block Soup"), robust identity management using advanced cryptography, and a unique "Brokered Anonymity" system governed by a decentralized Quorum. This allows for user privacy while maintaining accountability through threshold consensus. Our goal is to foster a collaborative "Revolution Network" incentivizing positive contributions through a novel reputation and valuation system, all built on an Ethereum-compatible foundation optimized for sustainability and enhanced security without relying on proof-of-work. Currently in pre-alpha, our focus is on completing the core library implementing these groundbreaking features.
