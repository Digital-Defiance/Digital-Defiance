# OpenBook

**Project:** OpenBook  
**Git Repo:** [https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/OpenBook](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/OpenBook)  
**Description:** OpenBook is a unique, beta stage project that synchronizes a Git repository of Markdown files into MongoDB and enables data querying via Mongo and a REST API. The project combines the capabilities of Git, MongoDB, and Node.js, translates Markdown data into MongoDB records, and houses a node express RESTful service. A Docker image is also included for easy, platform-independent deployment. While still in development, OpenBook presents a novel approach to managing and querying small datasets.
