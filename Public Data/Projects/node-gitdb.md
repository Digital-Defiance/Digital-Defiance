# node-GitDB

**Project:** node-GitDB
**Git Repo:** [https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/node-gitdb](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/node-gitdb)
**Description:** Node-GitDB is a unique, pre-alpha stage project that synchronizes a Git repository of Markdown files into MongoDB and enables data querying via Mongo and a REST API. The project combines the capabilities of Git, MongoDB, and Node.js, and consists of two main components: node-gitdb-lib, which translates Markdown data into MongoDB records, and node-gitdb, a wrapper that exposes this functionality as a RESTful service. A Docker image is also included for easy, platform-independent deployment. While still in development, Node-GitDB presents a novel approach to managing and querying small datasets.
