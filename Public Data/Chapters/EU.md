## Notes

- The US Chapter provisionally maintains the membership for EU and other members outside the US. This is a temporary measure until we grow enough to have a separate chapter for each region.
- Until then, the US Chapter will have a Foreign Advisory Board to represent the interests of members outside the US.
- The US Chapter shall be responsible for ensuring grants are not used outside of their intended purposes by the grantors, which will likely vary from grant to grant. Even email addresses may have implications not considered to our ability to secure grants/discounts via TechSoup from certain organizations, and/or directly.
