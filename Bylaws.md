## Article I: Name and Purpose

### Section 1. Name

The name of this organization shall be Digital Defiance.

### Section 2. Purpose

Digital Defiance is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes, within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of this organization shall be to create a fellowship of software engineers who mentor new and seasoned colleagues alike and work together on projects of public utility and interest, thereby promoting the progress of science and useful arts (as defined in the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8) as well as promoting civil discourse and the free exchange of ideas. Further, this organization shall have an interest in promoting a civil society through software by assisting in or developing software that promotes the rule of law in the physical world.

### Section 3. Mission Statement

The mission of Digital Defiance, a non-profit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is to foster an inclusive community of software engineers committed to educating, mentoring, and collaboratively working on projects that serve the public interest and advance the frontiers of science and useful arts. By embracing the free exchange of ideas and civil discourse, we aspire to strengthen our democratic principles as highlighted in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, our organization is dedicated to promoting a civil society through the creation and enhancement of software that aids in upholding the rule of law in the physical world.

Digital Defiance is poised to grow from a single, United States Chapter to possibly including an EU Chapter. As the organization grows, a parent organization of the same name shall form and each subsequent chapter, as it becomes a part of Digital Defiance, will uphold this mission, ensuring unity in our global efforts. However, membership management and tracking may vary from chapter to chapter due to jurisdictional differences.

### Section 4. Stated Goals

In addition to our Mission Statement, we adhere to the following Stated Goals:

- Cultivate professional growth among developers by imparting Agile methodologies, test-driven development, and other essential enterprise practices.
- Equip developers with necessary software and resources, either at no cost or at negotiated preferential rates, to facilitate efficient software development.
- Identify and enhance valuable public software that could benefit from our expertise, particularly those offering financial rewards for improvements or fixes. These rewards will be allocated to cover our operational costs and potentially serve as bonus incentives for our contributing developers.
- Commit to the creation of new software using thorough testing and development methodologies that uphold the integrity of scalable and reliable software.
- Whenever feasible, prioritize projects that contribute to a civil society and support the enforcement of the rule of law in the physical world.
