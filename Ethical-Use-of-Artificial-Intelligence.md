# Ethical and Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence

[Microsoft Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai)

AI needs constant monitoring to ensure that the data is not being misused or extrapolated from in a way that might disenfranchise someone due to training bias brought in during the model training. AI should never be used for hiring and firing, etc.

Please review ethical conduct standards regarding the use of AI in our Code (CoPilot, CodeGPT, etc) and in our projects as an API such as Duality Social.
