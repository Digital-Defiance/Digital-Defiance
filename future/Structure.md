# Digital Defiance: Organizational Structure

Digital Defiance is a non-profit organization, registered under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, based in Washington State, USA. The organization was established with the aim to cultivate a community of software engineers who are dedicated to collaborating on projects of high societal value and advancing the field of software development.

## Organizational Chapters
Currently, Digital Defiance operates with a single chapter, i.e., the United States Chapter. However, the organization envisions expanding and incorporating chapters from other countries and regions like the European Union, in the future. 

Each chapter of Digital Defiance, irrespective of their geographical location, will abide by the organization's mission statement. Notwithstanding this common adherence to the mission, each chapter might adopt different mechanisms for membership management and tracking, considering their respective local jurisdictions. 

At the moment, all members are accounted for under the United States Chapter, given it is the only active chapter. The members from other countries also vote under this chapter. Once new chapters are formed, members will vote within their respective chapters.

## Board of Directors
In terms of governance, each chapter of Digital Defiance, upon its formation, will have the right to nominate one representative to the board of the parent organization. The board is tasked with overseeing the alignment of each chapter's operations with the overall mission of Digital Defiance, resolving any strategic disputes, and guiding the organization's growth.

## Mission Statement
The mission of Digital Defiance is to build an inclusive community of software engineers that focuses on education, mentorship, and collaborative projects serving the public interest. The organization promotes a culture of free exchange of ideas and civil discourse, in order to strengthen democratic principles. A special emphasis is laid on developing software that aids in upholding the rule of law in the physical world.

## Membership and Benefits
Members of Digital Defiance enjoy several benefits, including access to free and discounted resources, which are to be used exclusively for creating open-source software for non-commercial use. The funds generated through donations or membership fees are utilized to cover operational costs. Any surplus might potentially be used as incentives for contributing developers.
