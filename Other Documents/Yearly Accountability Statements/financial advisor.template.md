Dear Colleagues,

As a Financial Advisor for Digital Defiance, I affirm that I have conscientiously executed my responsibilities and duties to our Guild, the general public, our associates, and benefactors over the previous calendar year.

My main role within the Guild involves vigilant supervision of our financial activities, encompassing the examination of revenues, expenditures, charitable donations, and other monetary transactions. Additionally, I provide advice to the Board of Directors on financial affairs, facilitating accuracy and currency in our financial records. In adherence to the best of my capabilities, I will continue to offer guidance on compliance matters, encompassing legal necessities and regulations, such as tax return deadlines and other statutory reports.

While it is acknowledged that Financial Advisors are exempt from active participation in daily Guild affairs, discussions, or official assemblies, I pledge to employ the advantages of my membership solely towards the enhancement of Open Source software development, aligning with the mission of our Guild.

The responsibility attached to being a Guild member is something I fully recognize, and I hereby vow to use any software received or licensed through our membership for the purpose of contributing to open-source projects and ensuring they are not intended for profit or commercial exploitation.

In my continued role as Financial Advisor, I am committed to contributing to the overall prosperity of our organization by maintaining diligent oversight of financial affairs and compliance. In unity, we will persist in making a meaningful contribution to the open-source community.

With sincerity,

[Your Name]
