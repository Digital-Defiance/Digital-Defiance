YYYY/MM/DD

New Member Certification - [Your Name]

Colleagues,

I am joining Digital Defiance as a

- [ ] Board Member <sup>&dagger;</sup>
- [ ] Research Partner <sup>&ddagger;</sup>
- [ ] Code Contributing Member <sup>&#x2E38;</sup>
- [ ] Advisory Member <sup>&#x2E38;</sup>

For Board Members and Research Partners, I understand and attest to the following; and for Code Contributing and Advisory members, I may optionally request access to Guild resources by certifying below:

- [ ] If checked, I certify that I am requesting access to Guild resources and will, therefore, be held accountable to the public, our donors, partners, and the Guild through yearly accountability statements. This will include citing some of my work in Open Source throughout the year.

As a dedicated member of this Guild, I am fully committed to upholding the principles of open-source software and actively contributing to the growth and success of our community. My membership benefits will be utilized exclusively for the advancement of open-source software development.

Should I choose to receive Guild resources, I acknowledge the responsibility it entails. I solemnly promise to use any granted or licensed software obtained through our membership solely for contributing to open-source projects and to complete the Yearly Accountability Statements which will also help to showcase my work as part of the Guild for the public.

In order to foster a conducive learning environment for all, I eagerly look forward to actively participating in meetings, discussions, sharing knowledge, and providing support to fellow members in their open-source endeavors to the best of my ability and time availability. I understand that abstaining from a meeting or vote means my voice will not be heard and may cause meetings to be delayed if there isn't sufficient membership to have the quorum required for a vote.

I have reviewed the [Corporate Bylaws](../Bylaws.md) and clearly understand the requirements of my chosen role.

I am excited to be part of the Digital Defiance community and I am committed to making a positive impact on the world of Open Source software.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Notes:
 See the bylaws (Article III Section 1) for additional information on these membership types. All resource allocations are made by the Board, including email boxes.

​ <sup>*</sup> Social Members are participatory in one of our online communities, such as the forum on our website or Discord, but are not eligible to receive or utilize Guild resources as that requires additional oversight and accountability. This letter is not required for or applicable to Social Members.
​ <sup>&dagger;</sup> A Board Member has extensive obligations to the Guild and the public, has full access to the breadth of operations of the Guild and therefore must also submit a Yearly Statement of Accountability, but it does not need to demonstrate public work- only a certification that the member fulfilled their obligations as a Board Member that calendar year.
​ <sup>&ddagger;</sup> A Research Partner is a member actively involved in developing novel concepts or projects, using a portion of grants and donations, with access to most unallocated Guild resources. They must submit a yearly statement certifying the responsible use of resources, and their work descriptions and links to code or papers will be showcased in the organization's GitHub repository. The statement is very similar to this one, but includes citations of work.
​ <sup>&#x2E38;</sup> Code Contributing and Advisory members have potential access to Guild resources, provided they submit a yearly statement.

The following section is for Official Board Use Only upon vetting:
