Dear Colleagues,

As a newly appointed Financial Advisor for Digital Defiance, I am excited to embark on this journey of dutifully executing my responsibilities to our Guild, the general public, our associates, and benefactors in the coming year.

In my role as a Financial Advisor, I will conscientiously supervise our financial activities. This includes managing our revenues, expenditures, charitable donations, and other monetary transactions. Additionally, I will be providing advice to the Board of Directors on financial matters, ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of our financial records. I am committed to providing guidance on compliance with legal requirements and regulations, such as tax return deadlines and other statutory reports, to the best of my abilities.

Although Financial Advisors may not be involved in the daily activities, discussions, or official meetings of the Guild, I vow to leverage the benefits of my membership for the sole purpose of promoting Open Source software development, thus aligning with the mission of our Guild.

I fully understand and accept the responsibility that comes with being a Guild member. I pledge to use any software granted or licensed through our membership exclusively for contributing to open-source projects, ensuring they are not aimed at profit-making or commercial exploitation.

In my role as Financial Advisor, I am determined to contribute to the overall success of our organization by diligently overseeing our financial affairs and compliance. Together, we can continue to make a significant impact on the open-source community.

I am eagerly looking forward to this journey, and should there be any inquiries or if assistance is required on any projects, please feel free to reach out to me.

With sincerity,

[Your Name]
