# Digital Defiance
## Tackling the Nebraskan projects for all humankind
### Join the Defiant effort against mediocre code and foreign actor exploits.

A non-profit group of Software Engineers working together to make the best use of their free time in order to further projects of value to mankind.

* Founded in 2022 by Jessica Mulein, aka "Freddie Mercurial" on GitHub with the help of BDisp and Rui Campos.
* We have our own passion projects which are generally for the planet, both fun/demonstrative as well as libraries to enable those.
* We also look for deserving open source projects that need either process coaching, an extra hand fixing bugs, or any other need.
* Contributors generally help each-other's passion projects and work towards common goals as a team to work more effectively.
* Contributors receive peer mentoring and learn agile processes and enterprise development methodologies
* Everyone is essentially a partner in an open source group run like a high velocity agile team at any big enterprise
  - Okay! Okay! You got me! Slow velocity, but we'll get there!
  - Also there is absolutely zero pressure to perform at any given time! Whatever anyone contributes is great, but try not to commit to work and vanish!

## The Name
FreddieMercurial has been working on a massive scale project called "The Revolution Network" and "Digital Rebellion" was frankly all they could think of in line with that. After a team discussion and evolutionary process, "Digital Defiance" emerged unexpectedly and won.
