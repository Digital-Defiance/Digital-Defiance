## Tackling the Nebraskan projects for all humankind

Software Engineers working together to make the best use of their free time in order to further projects of value to mankind.

We have some of our own projects, both fun/demonstrative as well as libraries to enable those.

We also look for deserving open source projects that need either process coaching, an extra hand fixing bugs, or any other need.

Contributors generally help each-other's side projects and work towards common goals as a team to work more effectively.
