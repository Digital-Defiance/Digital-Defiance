# Digital Rebellion
## Tackling the Nebraskan projects for all humankind
### Join the "rebellion" against mediocrity and foreign actor exploits.
* Software Engineers working together to make the best use of their free time in order to further projects of value to mankind.
* We have our own passion projects which are generally for the planet, both fun/demonstrative as well as libraries to enable those.
* We also look for deserving open source projects that need either process coaching, an extra hand fixing bugs, or any other need.
* Contributors generally help each-other's passion projects and work towards common goals as a team to work more effectively.
* Contributors receive peer mentoring and learn agile processes and enterprise development methodologies
* Everyone is essentially a partner in an open source group run like a high velocity agile team at any big enterprise
  - Okay! Okay! You got me! Slow velocity, but we'll get there!
  - Also there is absolutely zero pressure to perform at any given time! Whatever anyone contributes is great, but try not to commit to work and vanish!

## The Name
Frankly, the name is not my (FreddieMercurial's) favorite. I have been working on a massive scale project called "The Revolution Network", so "Digital Rebellion" was frankly all I could think of in line with that.

Both names are up for change. Are you in marketing? Help out!
