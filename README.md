A federally recognized 501c3 non-profit group of Open Source Software Engineers working together to make the best use of their free time in order to further projects of value to mankind.

* Founded in 2022, incorporated officially in 2023 by Jessica Mulein with the help of BDisp and Rui Campos.
* We have our own passion projects which are generally for the planet, both fun/demonstrative as well as libraries to enable those.
* We also look for deserving open source projects that need either process coaching, an extra hand fixing bugs, or any other need.
* Contributors generally help each-other's passion projects and work towards common goals as a team to work more effectively.
* Contributors receive peer mentoring and learn agile processes and enterprise development methodologies
* Everyone is essentially a partner in an open source group run like a high velocity agile team at any big enterprise
  - Okay! Okay! You got me! Slow velocity, but we'll get there!
  - Also there is absolutely zero pressure to perform at any given time! Whatever anyone contributes is great, but try not to commit to work and vanish!
* When you have someone on your team with DDM or DDGM behind their name, you have all of the Digital Defiance Guild behind you. We all help each other on any project- with a focus on open source. You know you are getting a person who has a vocal interest in the open source community and who also has the support of that community.
  
## 501c3 Open Source Software Engineering Guild
- Members get access to discounted software and other perks with our nonprofit status.
  - Software useful for and to be used only for open source development.
- Hopefully members get an email but currently that costs $35/user/year.
- Members mentor each other using our pet projects that are generally for the public good.
- Members try to prioritize working on designated critical tasks from community projects- generally on GitHub.
- We'll have occasional meetings to discuss which project tasks go to the top of the pile and try to generally follow and teach Agile principles.
- There is already a 24-7 chatroom on Discord where we already have multiple members discussing various projects being worked on.
- This is not (yet?) a union and we are open source developers working in an unpaid volunteer capacity.
- Dues will go towards our software subscriptions and other overhead
- Additional income beyond our needs will possibly be distributed to developers as bug/ticket bounties.
- If this sounds good to you, check out DigitalDefiance.org or email jessica@digitaldefiance.org

## Mission Statement
To create a fellowship of software engineers, mentoring new and seasoned colleagues alike, who will work together on projects of public utility and interest. We will gain new knowledge on our personal projects and select high priority work from the Open Source community.

### Stated Goals
 * Mentor developers in agile, test driven development, and other enterprise best practices
 * Provide software and other resources developers need either for free or at negotiated discount rates
 * Find needful software in the public that could benefit from our help, particularly those with monetary rewards for fixes.
 * Develop new software with proper testing and development methodologies that foster development of reliable, scalable software.

## The Name
"Digital Defiance" represents a group of open source software engineers who are challenging the traditional ways of working in the software industry. They are defying the notion that software development has to be done in a closed, proprietary environment. They are defying the idea that software engineers have to work in isolation, without support or mentorship.

By creating a community of software engineers who work together to further projects of value to mankind, Digital Defiance is defying the norm and taking a stand against the status quo. They are also defying the idea that software development is only for profit, by prioritizing projects of public utility and interest.

In short, Digital Defiance is a group of software engineers who are defying the traditional ways of working in the software industry, and instead are working together to create open source software that benefits society as a whole.
