# Partners and Donors

## Microsoft and GitHub

Microsoft has donated $1000 for Azure, $2500 for OpenAI, and numerous free accounts for M365 and Azure.
GitHub has given us non-profit status, including unlimited enterprise level accounts.
With around 10 members and counting, at tens of dollars a month per user, those accounts at M365, Azure, and GitHub are worth a pile of money too.
Jessica Mulein is working on Duality Social, a social network, and AI Against Humanity, a game. Digital Defiance is the owner of the copyright, but it’s all MIT licensed open source*.
*I’m holding on to the AI Against Humanity source until release.

## Studio3T

[Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com) has graciously given us a 50% discount on all licenses. We presently own one ‘Ultimate’ seat.

## NX / Nrwl.io

[NX](https://nrwl.io) is a next generation build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations. It works well with yarn, React, Angular, and other critical components of an open source project.

Several of our projects utilize NX and they are a company that supports Open Source Software. They have graciously granted Digital Defiance an open source license to NX Cloud. NX partitions a command into smaller tasks and runs them in parallel, in the correct order. Nx Cloud takes it one step further and runs any command across multiple machines, while giving you a consolidated view of the command as if it ran locally.

## Mohammad Faiz
Mohammad, an individual, contributed a steeply discounted QuickBooks Pro for us to manage our accounting.
